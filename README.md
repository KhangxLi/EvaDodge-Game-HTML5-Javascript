# EvaDodge
A Html5/Javascript game where the player dodges objects as long as possible to get the highest score.  
The user is a blue circle and tries to dodge a red ball bouncing around the canvas. A yellow "missile" that is much slower than the red one hunts the player down to prevent immobility. The player loses health when in contact with the red or yellow balls. The red ball gets faster as the game progresses through the levels.  

My first attempt at making a game. Play the game on codepen: http://codepen.io/KhangxLi/full/KmaZOV or 
download the repository and open the html file with a browser. A keyboard is needed to play. EvaDodge is not optimized for touch screens (smartphones/tablets).  

This game is inspired by the classic Breakout game. I learned about collision detection and animation / movement control by reading a Breakout game tutorial. I had no prior formal education.  
The game is incomplete. Below are things I wanted to implement but couldn't because of my lack of knowledge and experience.

Thanks for playing!

### __Walkthrough__
* Red ball gets faster and faster;
* Yellow ball is deadly since it does not bounce off the player;
* Moving in the same direction as the red ball as it bounces off the player causes more health loss;
* Red ball becomes drunk and starts changing direction mid canvas at level 8.

### Ideas
+ Main menu
+ Get item to recover some health
+ Show collision damage through color change
+ Adding more red balls
+ Playable on touch screen devices
+ Mouse control (maybe in another game mode)
+ Scoreboard (I probably have to learn a dbsm)
+ Try again button
+ Pause game key
+ Sound effects and music
+ Get item or to a goal to get higher scores
