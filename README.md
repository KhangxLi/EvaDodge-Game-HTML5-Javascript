# EvaDodge
A Html5 / Javascript game where you dodge objects as long as possible to get the highest score.  
This is my first attempt at making a game. You can play the game on codepen: http://codepen.io/KhangxLi/full/KmaZOV or 
download the repository and open the html file with your browser.  

Thanks for playing!

## Things to be added (I wish)
+ Main menu
+ Get item to recover some health
+ Show collision damage through color change
+ Adding more red balls
+ Playable on touch screen devices
+ Mouse control (maybe in another game mode)
+ Red ball changing direction for added difficulty
+ Scoreboard (I probably have to learn a dbsm)
+ Try again button
+ Pause game key
+ Sound effects and music
